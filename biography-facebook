Facebook: A Biography
Founded: February 4, 2004
Founders: Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.

Originally called "TheFacebook," it was created by Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg and his roommates as a platform for Harvard students to connect. Its popularity exploded, quickly expanding to other universities and then to the general public by 2006.

Driven by a simple mission—"to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together"—it revolutionized online communication. Key to its growth was the News Feed (2006), which centralized updates, and the platform's opening to third-party developers (2007).

Facebook acquired Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014), cementing its dominance. However, its history is also marked by controversies over user privacy, data handling (notably the Cambridge Analytica scandal), and its impact on society and politics.

In 2021, the parent company rebranded as Meta, signaling a shift in focus toward building the "metaverse," while the Facebook app remains one of the world's most used social networks.
